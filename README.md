# Enhancing-Neural-Network-Training-Through-GA-MCTS-OT-Project

Implementing a way to apply genetic algorithm (GA) and integrate it with Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to optimize the weights of the neural network. 

We first start by applying the genetic algorithm which includes various steps that rely on to biological concepts such as mutation and crossover. Afterwards, MCTS is added to the algorithm to further enhance the performance by providing an optimized way to search in the solution space. 
All algorithms used were discussed with great detail and description of the dataset was also reviewed. 

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains medical records from 768 Pima Indian women patients who are at least 21 years old.

Achieved accuracy:

Genetic Algorithm  91%
GA + MCTS          89.5%
